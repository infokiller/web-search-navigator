New in 0.3.3
* Link-opening shortcuts now prefer focused element over the highlighted
  result. Hence it is possible to navigate to sub-results and other links
  using the <tab> key.

New in 0.3.2
* Scroll to top of the page when navigating to the "previous" result from the
  first result and wrapping is off.
* Remove "People also ask" results from navigable results.

New in 0.3.1
* Fixed unpredictable scrolling in results navigation.

* Fixed scrolling to first result when page is loaded. This fixes an issue where
  the extension would scroll over KP cards (stock data, top stories).

New in 0.3.0
* Renamed the extension to comply with the branding guidelines of Google LLC.

New in 0.2.15
* Fixed "translate this site"-links being indexed as search results.

New in 0.2.14:
* Fixed search results matching in a new (or alternate?) Google™ search version.

New in 0.2.13:
* Fixed "Focus searchbox" shortcut not working in some cases.

New in 0.2.12:
* Added support for shopping results.

New in 0.2.11:
* Fixed options not being configurable for Firefox.

New in 0.2.9:
* Removed tabs permission which caused a scary Chrome warning about a new
  permission in the extension to read "browsing history". The issue was related to a new feature for opening a search result in the background- see the discussion in https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator/issues/53

NOTE FROM AUTHOR: sorry for that warning, but I can assure you that this extension DOES NOT READ ANY of your browsing history. You don't need to trust my word- you can read the source code in https://github.com/infokiller/web-search-navigator

New in 0.2.8:
* Changed default key binding of "Open selected result in new window/tab" to `Ctrl/⌘ + Shift + Enter/Space`.
* New feature for Navigation to a new tab in background (Ctrl/⌘ + Enter/Space)
* New keybindings for navigating between search result pages
* Added navigation to more tabs: shopping, books, flights, and financial.

New in 0.2.5:
* Keybindings for navigating to images/videos/maps/news tabs
* Works in encrypted.google.com

Simple open source extension that adds keyboard shortcuts to Google search™.
Google search™ used to provide experimental keyboard navigation, but it was
often broken (https://goo.gl/1zMkYu), and seems to have been removed as of
2017-07-31 (https://stackoverflow.com/a/45513198/1014208).  In addition, I
wanted to add new keyboard shortcuts and the existing ones to be more vim like
(j/k for navigation).
